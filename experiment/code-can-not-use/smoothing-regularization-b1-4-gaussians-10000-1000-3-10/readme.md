smoothing-regularization-4-gaussians: (5000, 5000), overfitting
smoothing-regularization-4-gaussians-10000-1000: (10000, 1000), but eraly stopping

(0) gm_prior_logistic_regression_fixed.py !!!!!!!!!!!! --> bias changed (standard)
(1) gm_prior_logistic_regression_fixed_modify --> bias not changed yet, bias still has regularization

3-8
(2) adding loss calculation
(3) mini-batch is sequential fetching samples now (index, index+batchsize)

3-10
different from git:
%10000 for convergence
3000000 steps and 1e-10 for convergence
(4) adding learning rate decay
(5) train loss for converge
(6) only train and test split
